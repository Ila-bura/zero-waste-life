# ZERO WASTE LIFE


Zero Waste Life is a site which aims at supporting people who are looking to reduce the amount of waste they produce on a daily basis. The site is targeted toward anyone who wish to be a bit more sustainable and is ready to make some changes in their everyday life, startuing in the kitchen. Zero Waste Life will provide useful tips and tricks to implement to have a more sustainable approach to how we buy, consume and store food.
The site will showcase a very simple and easy recipe to demonstrate how to use up carrots, an ingredient which is more often than not forgotten in the cupboad and therefore tends to be thrown away.
In a separate page of the site users will be able to watch a YouTube video with simple instructions on how to start composting, in the hope to encourage users to experiment with compostinmg in their house.
Users will also have the chance to sign up to a monthly newsletter and receive useful suggestions on how to reduce waste as well as a new seasonal recipe.
