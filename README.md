# ZERO WASTE LIFE


Zero Waste Life is a site which aims at supporting people who are looking to reduce the amount of waste they produce on a daily basis. The site is targeted toward anyone who wish to be a bit more sustainable and is ready to make some changes in their everyday life, startuing in the kitchen. Zero Waste Life will provide useful tips and tricks to have a more sustainable approach to how we buy, consume and store food.
The site will showcase a very simple and easy recipe to demonstrate how to use up carrots, an ingredient which is more often than not forgotten in the cupboad and therefore tends to be thrown away.
In a separate page of the site users will be able to watch a YouTube video with simple instructions on how to start composting, in the hope to encourage users to experiment with compostinmg in their house.
Users will also have the chance to sign up to a monthly newsletter and receive useful suggestions on how to reduce waste as well as a new seasonal recipe.

# UX

## Site Purpose
Provide useful and practical and easy to implement tips to encourage users to reduce food waste, including simple recipes and an educational tutorial video.

## Audience
Anyone who wish to leave the world as a better place and is willing to make an effort to reduce the amount of waste they produce in their daily activities. Our target audience spans from young professionals to stay-at-home parents, typically in the 20 to 45 age range. What they all have in common is they are passionate about sustainability, they carefully choose what to consume and they tend to prefer a vegetarian or vegan diet.  

## Communication
In line with the site ethos, the content is displayed in little "nuggets" of information, meant to be easily read without overwhelming the users. The text bubbles in every page are intended as "calls to action" to engage the users.

# Design


## Color Scheme
The starting point to develop a color scheme was inspired to match the colors in the picture chosen to be the background image for the site. The overall intent was to convey a sense of relaxation, with muted tones and delicate hues. The Chrome extension ColorZilla was used to pick specific colors from the background image, one of which was then converted to RGBA format to match the same hue for the background of the sections with text. ColorZilla was also used to pick a specific shade of white from the background image to be used for the form fields as well as the submit button.
ColorSpace was also used to generate matching gradient palette. 
To create a contrasting effect, the logo, the main headings and the text content have a darker tone. In keeping with the intent of creating a pleasant and relaxing effect, the black color was avoided in favour of less extreme shades.

## Typography
Cormorant Garamond was selected as the font family for the headings, primarily in bold, to achieve a stylized and sleek final effect. On the other hand, Source Code Pro was chosen for the body content: its unpretentious line vaguely remind of the text produced by a typing machine, which make the font esthetically pleasing yet keeping it easy to read. The font family was created using [Google Fonts]( https://fonts.google.com/).

## Imagery
The images and background video used for this website were sourced from the free stock photo platform Pexel.
The video withe the vase of flowers used as a background is by Artem Podrez and can be found [here](https://www.pexels.com/video/decorative-flower-in-glass-vase-against-white-background-4884243/).
The placeholder picture is a screenshot of the video then converted to webp format, using [birme.net](https://www.birme.net/?target_width=300&target_height=300&image_format=webp&quality_jpeg=100&quality_webp=100).

The picture of the fritters used in the recipe page is by Morena Vw and can be found [here](https://www.pexels.com/photo/zucchini-fritters-with-tomatoes-and-green-vegetables-on-white-ceramic-plate-6911885/). As a side note, finding a free stock photo of precisely carrot fritters proved harder than anticipated so eventually this zucchini fritters was chosen as a representative enough image to match the recipe.

The fritters image was resized and compressed using [Adobe Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/resize).

The favicon was created using the online generator available on [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/).


# Current Features

## Existing Features

### Logo
The logo can be seen on the upper left corner of every page of the website. Lacking the skills to design a proper logo from scratch, the logo is made up by two headings in bold: the website name "Zero Waste Life" and the mission statement/ethos "Live more sustainably", separated by a horizontal rule and wrapped in a rectangular box with solid border.

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is displayed across all pages and provides an intuitive reference to navigate between the different sections of the website. The names of the four elements in the menu clearly state the content of each page.

To fix the issue of the inverted order of the menu items, after researching online, a viable solution was found on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/ConStambo/pen/WxRQVq) by adding a float:left property to the li element coupled with a float:right property applied to the ul element.

Similar to how it was done in the Love Running walkthrough project, the menu links were set to underline to provide visual clues for the user as to what link they're about to click on when they hover over it with the cursor.
